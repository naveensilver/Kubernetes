In a production-grade environment, we begin by implementing default deny rules that block all traffic to every single pod, ensuring that no pods are connected by default. This means that all communication between pods is restricted until we explicitly allow it. We then create specific allow rules one by one, carefully defining the traffic that is necessary for the functionality of our applications
