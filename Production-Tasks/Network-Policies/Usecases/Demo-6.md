To ensure that certain sensitive applications in Kubernetes do not communicate with the internet, we can implement egress network policies that deny all outbound traffic to external IP addresses. This is crucial for meeting regulatory compliance and protecting sensitive data.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### Step 1: Set Up the Kubernetes Environment

Ensure you have a running Kubernetes cluster and `kubectl` configured to access it.

### Step 2: Create a Namespace for Sensitive Applications

We’ll create a dedicated namespace for the sensitive applications.

```bash
kubectl create namespace sensitive-apps
```

### Step 3: Deploy a Sensitive Application

Let’s deploy a sample sensitive application. For this example, we'll use an Nginx pod to represent the sensitive application.

**sensitive-app-deployment.yaml**:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: sensitive-app
  namespace: sensitive-apps
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: sensitive-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: sensitive-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: sensitive-app
        image: nginx:alpine
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "tail -f /dev/null"]  # Keep the container running
```

Apply the deployment:

```bash
kubectl apply -f sensitive-app-deployment.yaml
```

### Step 4: Create an Egress Network Policy

Now, we’ll create an egress network policy that denies all outbound traffic to external IP addresses from the sensitive application pods.

**deny-egress-policy.yaml**:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-external-egress
  namespace: sensitive-apps
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: sensitive-app
  policyTypes:
  - Egress
  egress:
  - to:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 0.0.0.0/0  # Deny all external traffic
```

Apply the egress network policy:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deny-egress-policy.yaml
```

### Step 5: Testing the Egress Restrictions

To verify that the egress restrictions work as expected, we’ll attempt to access an external service from the sensitive application pod.

#### 5.1 Get Pod Name

First, get the name of the sensitive application pod:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n sensitive-apps
```

#### 5.2 Test Access to External Service

Start a shell in the sensitive application pod:

```bash
kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pods -n sensitive-apps -l app=sensitive-app -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') -n sensitive-apps -- /bin/sh
```

Inside the sensitive application pod, try to access an external service:

```bash
curl http://httpbin.org/get
```

You should receive a connection error, confirming that the sensitive application pod cannot access external services.

### Conclusion

You have successfully implemented an egress network policy that restricts all outbound traffic to external IP addresses from sensitive application pods. This setup helps ensure compliance with regulatory requirements by preventing sensitive applications from communicating with the internet.
