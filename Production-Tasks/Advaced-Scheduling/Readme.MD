In Kubernetes (K8s), **scheduling** is the process of assigning pods (a group of one or more containers) to nodes in a cluster. The Kubernetes scheduler is responsible for making this decision, and it ensures that pods are distributed efficiently across nodes based on certain constraints and requirements.

Here’s an overview of how scheduling works in Kubernetes:

### 1. **Pod Creation**
   When a pod is created, it gets submitted to the Kubernetes API server, but it doesn't run immediately. It enters the **Pending** state, waiting for the scheduler to assign it to an appropriate node.

### 2. **Scheduler's Role**
   The Kubernetes scheduler runs as a control plane component and is responsible for finding the best node for each pod to run on. The scheduler does this based on:
   
   - **Resource requirements** (e.g., CPU, memory)
   - **Node affinity** (e.g., where the pod should or should not run)
   - **Taints and tolerations** (to prevent certain pods from running on specific nodes)
   - **Pod affinity/anti-affinity** (how pods should be placed relative to other pods)
   - **Available resources** on each node
   - **Other constraints** defined through Kubernetes configuration

### 3. **Scheduling Process**
   The scheduler goes through the following steps to decide where to run the pod:

   1. **Filtering**: 
      The scheduler first filters out nodes that cannot run the pod. It considers the following factors:
      - **Resource availability**: The node must have enough resources (CPU, memory, etc.) to run the pod.
      - **Taints and Tolerations**: If a node has taints, the scheduler checks if the pod has matching tolerations. If not, that node is excluded.
      - **Node Affinity**: This checks if the pod has any specific requirements to run on a certain set of nodes (like running in a certain zone or region).
      - **Pod Affinity/Anti-Affinity**: If the pod has affinity or anti-affinity rules, the scheduler will ensure that the pod is placed according to those rules (e.g., on the same node or different node as specific pods).
   
   2. **Scoring**: 
      After filtering, the scheduler ranks the remaining nodes based on certain scoring criteria. For example:
      - **Resource utilization**: It tries to distribute pods evenly across nodes to avoid resource contention.
      - **Data locality**: Pods might be scheduled on nodes that are closer to the resources (e.g., databases, persistent storage).
      - **Least number of pods on a node**: It can help balance the number of pods across nodes to prevent overloading any single node.
   
   3. **Selection**: 
      The scheduler selects the node with the best score and assigns the pod to that node.

### 4. **Pod Scheduling Algorithms**
   Kubernetes uses a set of algorithms to make the scheduling decision, such as:
   - **First Fit**: Assigns the pod to the first node that fits the pod’s requirements.
   - **Best Fit**: Chooses the node that has the best resources available for the pod.
   - **Spread**: Tries to evenly distribute pods across the available nodes.
   - **Balanced Resource**: This tries to balance the resources (e.g., CPU and memory) used across nodes.

### 5. **Post-Scheduling**
   After the pod is scheduled, the Kubernetes controller manager starts the process of **pod creation** on the chosen node. The kubelet on that node is responsible for pulling the container images, starting the containers, and maintaining the pod’s state.

### 6. **Dynamic Adjustments**
   - **Resource utilization changes**: As resources on nodes change (due to load or other scheduling decisions), the scheduler may re-assess pod placement for optimization.
   - **Preemption**: In case of resource shortages, Kubernetes may preempt (evict) lower-priority pods to make space for higher-priority ones, depending on how priorities are set for the pods.

### 7. **Custom Scheduling**
   Kubernetes also supports **custom schedulers**. While the default scheduler handles most workloads, users can define and implement their own scheduling policies using a custom scheduler. For example, a user might want to write a custom scheduler for workload-specific behavior, such as scheduling pods based on specific custom metrics, node availability, or external factors.

### Key Concepts and Components Involved:
- **Scheduler**: The primary component that makes the scheduling decision.
- **Node**: A machine (physical or virtual) in the Kubernetes cluster that hosts pods.
- **Pod**: The smallest deployable unit that contains one or more containers.
- **API Server**: Kubernetes API server that stores pod data and receives pod creation requests.
- **Kubelet**: An agent that runs on each node in the cluster to manage pod lifecycle.

### Key Scheduling Policies:
1. **Affinity & Anti-Affinity**: Used to control where pods should or should not be placed based on the labels of other pods or nodes.
2. **Taints & Tolerations**: Prevent pods from being scheduled onto inappropriate nodes unless they explicitly tolerate those taints.
3. **Resource Requests & Limits**: Pods can specify the minimum and maximum resources (like CPU and memory) they need.
4. **Priority Classes**: Allows for prioritizing pods, so that higher-priority pods get scheduled first, and lower-priority pods might get preempted when resources are scarce.

In summary, Kubernetes scheduling is a complex process aimed at optimizing the placement of pods across the cluster while adhering to the constraints and preferences set by users. The Kubernetes scheduler is responsible for ensuring that pods are placed on suitable nodes while balancing resource utilization, node availability, and other requirements.
