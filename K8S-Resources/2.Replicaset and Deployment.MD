Kubernetes concepts such as **self-healing**, **high availability**, and the process of **rollout and rollback** using **ReplicaSets** and **Deployments**. 

1. **Introduction**: Here, We explores how Kubernetes enables self-healing and high availability for applications. It highlights the importance of multiple application instances (replicas) for production environments to ensure uptime and reliability.

2. **ReplicaSets**:
   - A **ReplicaSet** ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running at all times.
   - It automatically replaces failed pods to maintain the desired state (self-healing).
   - A YAML file is created to define a ReplicaSet, where the number of replicas is specified, and pods are generated with matching [labels].
   - If a node goes down, the ReplicaSet automatically recreates the pods on a healthy node.

3. **Deployment**:
   - **Deployments** provide additional capabilities over ReplicaSets, including automated **rollouts** and **rollbacks**.
   - A **Deployment** creates a ReplicaSet and manages it.
   - The deployment YAML is similar to ReplicaSet but includes options for updating application versions.
   - Rollout and rollback are handled automatically when updating the Deployment’s specification.

4. **Hands-On Examples**:
   - **ReplicaSets** were demonstrated with the creation of three replicas of an Nginx pod, showing how Kubernetes automatically recreates pods when they are deleted.
   - **Node Failure Handling**: By deleting a node, Kubernetes automatically reassigning the pods to a new healthy node, demonstrating high availability.
   - **Deployment Rollout and Rollback**: The Demo details how a deployment can be updated by changing the application’s version. Rollbacks to a previous version are also demonstrated using both the spec file and `kubectl` commands.

5. **Scaling**:
   - Applications can be scaled up or down by adjusting the number of replicas in the deployment YAML file or using `kubectl` commands.
   - The importance of consistency between spec files and cluster state is emphasized to avoid discrepancies.

The Demo provides a comprehensive look at how Kubernetes achieves **fault tolerance**, **application upgrades**, and **version management** through its resource objects.

### Step-by-Step Guide for Working with **ReplicaSets** and **Deployments** in Kubernetes

#### **1. ReplicaSet**

A **ReplicaSet** ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running in a cluster at all times. It automatically replaces any failed pods to maintain the desired state.

---

### **Step 1: Create a ReplicaSet YAML File**

First, create a YAML file named `replicaset.yaml` to define the ReplicaSet configuration. This ReplicaSet will ensure 3 Nginx pods are always running.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: nginx-replicaset
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3  # Number of pod replicas to run
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### **Step 2: Deploy the ReplicaSet**

Apply the `replicaset.yaml` file to create the ReplicaSet in your Kubernetes cluster.

```bash
kubectl apply -f replicaset.yaml
```

### **Step 3: Verify the ReplicaSet**

To confirm that the ReplicaSet and its pods are running, use the following commands:

```bash
kubectl get replicaset
kubectl get pods
```

You should see 3 pods running, as defined by the ReplicaSet.

### **Step 4: Simulate Failure and Observe Self-Healing**

To simulate a pod failure, delete one of the pods. The ReplicaSet will automatically create a new pod to replace the deleted one.

```bash
kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
kubectl get pods  # Observe that a new pod is created
```

You’ll notice that after deleting a pod, a new one is automatically created by the ReplicaSet to maintain the desired state of 3 replicas.

### **Step 5: Node Failures for High Availability**

ReplicaSets also ensure high availability. If a node hosting a pod goes down, the ReplicaSet recreates the pods on a different healthy node to maintain the desired number of replicas.

#### How to simulate this:
1. **Simulate node failure:** Drain or cordon a node:
   ```bash
   kubectl drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets
   ```
2. **Observe the pod rescheduling**: Use the command to check the new node:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -o wide
   ```

The pods will be recreated on another available node, ensuring high availability and self-healing.

---

#### **2. Deployment**

A **Deployment** offers more advanced features compared to ReplicaSets, such as automated rolling updates, rollbacks, and version control and we can give [Deployment Strategies]. It manages ReplicaSets, ensuring that the deployment state matches the desired specification.

---
A Deployment defines how your application should be deployed and manages the lifecycle of your pods. It provides features such as scaling, updating, and rolling back.

### **Step 1: Create a Deployment YAML File**

Let’s define a `deployment.yaml` file for managing 3 replicas of an Nginx server, similar to a ReplicaSet but with additional update and rollback capabilities.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  #annotations:
    #kubernetes.io/change-cause: "Updating to *** image"
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.21.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### **Step 2: Deploy the Deployment**

Deploy the `nginx-deployment` to your Kubernetes cluster.

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

### **Step 3: Verify the Deployment**

Check the status of the Deployment, ReplicaSet, and pods:

```bash
kubectl get deployment
kubectl get replicasets
kubectl get pods
```

You should see 3 pods created and managed by the Deployment.

---

### **Step 4: Rolling Updates**

A Deployment allows you to update the application version with minimal downtime using rolling updates.

#### Step 1: Update the Deployment YAML

Let’s update the Nginx version from `1.21.0` to `1.22.0`.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  # annotations:
    # kubernetes.io/change-cause: "Updating to *** image" # Specify the change cause for ref 
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.22.0  # Updated version
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

#### Step 2: Apply the Update

Apply the new deployment file:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

#### Step 3: Monitor the Rolling Update

Use the following command to monitor the status of the rolling update:

```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment
```

The pods will be gradually replaced by the new version (`nginx:1.22.0`), ensuring zero downtime.

---

### **Step 5: Rollback to a Previous Version**

If you encounter an issue after an update, you can easily roll back to the previous version.

#### Step 1: Rollback the Deployment

To rollback the Deployment to the previous state:

```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment
```

#### Step 2: Verify the Rollback

Check the deployment and pods to ensure the rollback has taken effect:

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

The pods should now be running the previous version (`nginx:1.21.0`).

---

### **6. Check Deployment History**

Kubernetes keeps track of the deployment revisions, allowing you to inspect the history and rollback to any revision.

#### Step 1: View Deployment History

To view the revision history of a Deployment, run:

```bash
kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment
```

This will show you a list of revisions and changes made to the Deployment.

#### Step 2: Rollback to a Specific Revision

If you want to rollback to a specific revision (e.g., revision 2), you can specify the revision number:

```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment --to-revision=2
```

Verify that the rollback has been applied:

```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment
```

---

### **7. Pausing and Resuming a Deployment**

Sometimes, you may want to pause a rolling update to avoid making further changes while troubleshooting or analyzing the update.

#### Step 1: Pause the Deployment

To pause a Deployment, run:

```bash
kubectl rollout pause deployment/nginx-deployment
```

While paused, you can make additional changes to the Deployment YAML.

#### Step 2: Resume the Deployment

After making the required changes, resume the update process:

```bash
kubectl rollout resume deployment/nginx-deployment
```

Kubernetes will continue the rolling update process from where it was paused.


### **Summary**

- **ReplicaSet** ensures that a set number of pods are always running and can automatically recover from pod and node failures.
- **Deployments** provide advanced features like rolling updates, rollbacks, and version control, offering more flexibility for managing application lifecycles.
- **Scaling**: Easily increase or decrease the number of pod replicas.
- **Rolling Updates**: Gradually replace old pods with new ones to ensure zero downtime.
- **Rollbacks**: Revert to a previous version if an update fails.
- **Deployment History**: Keep track of deployment revisions and rollback to any previous state.
- **Pause and Resume**: Pause and resume rolling updates for better control.

By following these steps, you have a complete hands-on understanding of how to work with **ReplicaSets** and **Deployments** in Kubernetes.
